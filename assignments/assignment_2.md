## Assignment 2
### Putting a project under version control
**due at 12 noon on 2015-10-28** via Github

## Instructions

Use your computational cookie cutter script to create a project directory for your Final 
Project and put this project under version control locally and remotely using Git & Github.

* Create a local and remote Git/Github repository for the student's Final Project.
* The README in the project's root directory should contain the project title, the students name and the date. These changes should be versioned (*i.e.,* added and committed to Git).
* The student should choose a license for their project and add this information to the LICENSE.md file. This change should be versioned. See [this page](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/11-licensing.html) from Software Carpentry for some general info about Software licenses.
* Commit messages should be meaningful, see [this blog post](https://www.connectivedx.com/thinking/posts/2015/02/guidelines-better-github-messages) for hints/tips.
