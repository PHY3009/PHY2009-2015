## Final project topic and question inspiration

Having trouble thinking of what to do for your final project in PHY3009? Take a look at 
the examples project ideas from the Seattle Colleges below to help get you brainstorming 
on your own project. These suggestions are intentionally not from the physical sciences, 
and are meant to provide simple examples without technical jargon.

**Example Social Media Research Question**: Can sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews be used to 
predict star ratings?

Background: Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, refers to the use of text
analysis to draw conclusion regarding the emotional state of the author of a given sample 
of text at the time the text was written. Sentiment analysis scores words based on how 
commonly they are associated with negative or positive sentiments. This data is especially 
useful to businesses in evaluating their online reputations as determined by online 
reviews and references in social media sites.

Possible questions to investigate include:
• Can we reliably analyze reviews on Yelp and predict how positive or negative the review is?
• Can we create a reliable scoring system for words commonly found in Yelp reviews?

Data: The [Yelp academic dataset] (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)


### Here's a few other ideas:

**Economics:**

a. Question: How do employment status and income level correlate with expectations of crime victimization?

b. Data set: The [Survey of Economic Expectations data](http://www.nber.org/data/) available on the National Bureau of Economic Research website

**Climate and Conflict:**

a. Question: Does climate influence conflicts in Africa?

b. Data set: The [Armed Conflict Location and Events Dataset](http://www.acleddata.com/data/) and the [National Climatic Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html)

### Other things to think about:

There are TONS of public datasets out there! Think about your area of interest and 
questions you have about that topic. Search for public datasets in that research area and
take a look at them to see if they can help you answer any of your questions? Could you 
use these datasets to build a model that predicts something about the future, or another
location? 

Use your mentor as another source for help when developing your project idea and while you 
are working on your final project. They are closer to your Question that I am and can 
provide some more domain specific advice.
