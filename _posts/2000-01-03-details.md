## Assignments:

Assignments will consist of applying the material learned in class to the students final 
project. A detailed list of assignments and assignment expectations will be provided on 
the first day of class. Assignment grading will be broken down as 40% for the planning and 
documentation of how the problem will be solved, 20% for how accurate the code is, 20% 
for how reusable the code is, and 20% for how readable the code is. In other words, code 
that does not work can get a maximum of 40%.

**Assignments are due 12:00 noon on the day indicated!**

For week 1, assignments can be submitted to me via [email](mailto:tiffany.timbers@gmail.com). 

From week 2 onwards, assignment submission will be via Github.
