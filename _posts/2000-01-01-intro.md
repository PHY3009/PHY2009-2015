## Computation in the Physical Sciences
{: .text-purple}

Take your Question to the next level with high level computational open source programming 
language: Python! Students begin with the basics of coding in the first few days: 
variables, loops and functions. Students will learn critical practices to carry out a 
computational project from beginning to end, including code modularization, readability 
and re-use, as well as version control to organize their coding projects and collaborate 
effectively. Ultimately, students will use these tools to analyze their own datasets in a 
term project. For preparation, students will work through a sample dataset from a 
radioactive isotope decay experiment together as a class. Skills will be taught via a 
combination of live-coding sessions and work-along sessions. Think of it as a guided three 
hour hackathon each day of the block.
