## Group Code Review

Group Code Review will be done in preassigned small groups of ~ 3-4 and facilitated 
by the tutor. Students will share the code that they have recently written for their final
project, along with a written [plan](http://billmills.github.io/blog/ten-minute-plans/) 
about what the code is supposed to do. The other students will read the shared plan and 
code, and then make comments and/or edits on it and submit these suggestions to the 
student who wrote the code via a pull request. The following day in class, each student 
will be given 5 minutes to share their most important piece of feedback on the code with 
the group. All participants will be expected to follow a strict [code of conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html). 
The assessment for the group code review will be 20% for the 10 minute plan for your code, 
60% for written comments on others code, and 20% for oral discussion of feedback on others 
code.
