## Final Project

Student's final Project topic will be decided on in the first week and ideally fall under 
the umbrella of the student's question. This will be done in consultation with the tutor. 
Students will work on the project over the duration of the course, applying what they 
learned in each class to their project with the daily assignments. Students will also be 
given 6 hours of in-class time to work on the final project at the end of the course. 
During these in class work-along sessions, students are encouraged to consult the tutor 
and each other for help when needed. The project will be done under version control and 
submitted as a repository to Github. This assessment will consist of a proposal (5%), the 
code and public repository (45%), a final written report (25%), and a 10 minute Jupyter 
notebook presentation of the project (25%).
